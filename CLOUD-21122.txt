STORY: As a webshop admin, I want a configuration to identify when the capture should be done for payments done via credit card for trade account user, so that webshop can initiate the capture based on their process

USER_FLOW:
N/A

WIREFRAMES:
N/A

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
# Configuration is available to identify when the capture of credit card funds to be done for trade account user (configuration is needed at Banner level)
# Configuration can either be after order is placed with ERP or after the goods are shipped
# For CA it is set to after order is placed with ERP and for FR it is is set to after goods are shipped 
# Changes are applied for payment done via Adyen
# For configuration set to after goods are shipped, capture will be initiated by ERP, no changes are needed on Hybris side
# Regression:
#* In scenario where addOrder fails, existing process is applied (if it fails, capture is not done and auth is cancelled)
#* In scenario where addOrder responds successfully or time out, it will be considered order was placed and capture request will be sent

1. We will still  send the capture data to the ERP in add order WS just like how we are sending in FR. is this a problem for CA?
